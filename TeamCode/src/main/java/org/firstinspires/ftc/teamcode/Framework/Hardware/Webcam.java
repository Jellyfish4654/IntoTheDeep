/*
 * This OpMode illustrates the basics of AprilTag based localization.
 *
 * For an introduction to AprilTags, see the FTC-DOCS link below:
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro.html
 *
 * In this sample, any visible tag ID will be detected and displayed, but only tags that are included in the default
 * "TagLibrary" will be used to compute the robot's location and orientation.  This default TagLibrary contains
 * the current Season's AprilTags and a small set of "test Tags" in the high number range.
 *
 * When an AprilTag in the TagLibrary is detected, the SDK provides location and orientation of the robot, relative to the field origin.
 * This information is provided in the "robotPose" member of the returned "detection".
 *
 * To learn about the Field Coordinate System that is defined for FTC (and used by this OpMode), see the FTC-DOCS link below:
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/game_specific_resources/field_coordinate_system/field-coordinate-system.html
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.

     * Variables to store the position and orientation of the camera on the robot. Setting these
     * values requires a definition of the axes of the camera and robot:
     *
     * Camera axes:
     * Origin location: Center of the lens
     * Axes orientation: +x right, +y down, +z forward (from camera's perspective)
     *
     * Robot axes (this is typical, but you can define this however you want):
     * Origin location: Center of the robot at field height
     * Axes orientation: +x right, +y forward, +z upward
     *
     * Position:
     * If all values are zero (no translation), that implies the camera is at the center of the
     * robot. Suppose your camera is positioned 5 inches to the left, 7 inches forward, and 12
     * inches above the ground - you would need to set the position to (-5, 7, 12).
     *
     * Orientation:
     * If all values are zero (no rotation), that implies the camera is pointing straight up. In
     * most cases, you'll need to set the pitch to -90 degrees (rotation about the x-axis), meaning
     * the camera is horizontal. Use a yaw of 0 if the camera is pointing forwards, +90 degrees if
     * it's pointing straight left, -90 degrees for straight right, etc. You can also set the roll
     * to +/-90 degrees if it's vertical, or 180 degrees if it's upside-down.
